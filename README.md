Hi,
I was in the Design Automation today. I seem to be missing a lot of code and the https://github.../aps-design-automation-dotnet is significantly different from what we went over today.

Can you share your solution on GIT with the xoom attendees from today to go with the recordings?

Thanks-
Ron

Hi Jo√£o : )

It doesn't have to be perfect - I just need reference material from what we learned so I can adapt it. The current GIT is outdated, and I just need a clone for my reference as I unfortunately had fires to put out during the training. If you could publish, I could clone and you could pull down. I would imagine the others on the call would find it useful.

Thanks!
